## requirement list (12.06.2022)
- read the dataset from a CSV file (characters) and in the end save cleaned data 
- find a way to deal with missing values (remove/mean/EM)
- group the dataset into meaningful units (houses)

statistical characteristics
- amount of blood in houses                                                                                                                                               
- correlation between amount of blood and house?

plot
- plot distribution of individual variables as bar plots (houses, species, blood status)

## meeting with tutor (14.06.2022)
We realized that we need to do more than data visualization. 
We decided to add quizes to determine whether the user is a Harry Potter fan so that the user can access the data visualization only after completing the quiz successfully. 

## Learning outcomes
We definitely were able to deepen our understanding of the pandas and mathplotlib libararies since we had to deal with them a lot. Furthermore, also that cleaning data can be really difficult, especially if the underlying data is pretty ambiguous. Also, having an appropiate evaluation function of written imput is hard to get and that may always overlook something. In context of that, we also learned that they are several approaches and measurements one can use to determine how closely related strings are. 

## Challenges and our Solutions
One of our hardest challenges was to figure out how exactly we want to work with our data sets. When we first started our goal was to create a couple of quizzes based on the data sets like a sorting hat, quote quiz, patronus test, and most similar character test. However, we soon realised that it is unfortunately not that easy, and we were just able to create a quote quiz. Therefore, we had to alter our initial plan. So, we kept the quote quiz and decided to do multiple plots instead, and it worked up and the result can now be seen here. 

## Further additions
- have the same colour for the same character in line distribution 
- add also the rest of the movie scripts to the data

## Work distribution
### Jessica
- read the dataset from a CSV file (Harry Potter 1.csv, Harry Potter 2.csv, Harry Potter 3.csv) and save the cleaned data 
- find a way to extract long enough quotes 
- create an evalution function of the user input taking into acccount spelling mistakes and name ambiguities 
- plot of the line distributions

### Wookyung 
- read the dataset from a CSV file (Characters.csv) and in the end save cleaned data 
- find a way to deal with missing values (remove, replace, rename)
- group the dataset into meaningful units (gender, houses, blood status, eye colour, hair colours, loyalty)
- plot of distribution of individual variables (gender, blood status, eye colour, hair colours, loyalty) as pie plots
