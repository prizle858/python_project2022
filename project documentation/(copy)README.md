# Harry Oh My Harry

- First we will give you a Quote quiz, testing whether you are a true fan or not. In our database we have files providing the script for the first three movies. We would draw quotes from that, ensuring that it is long enough, such that it is possible to recognize the lines. Furthermore, we also take spelling mistakes and name synomyms into account. 
- After you pass the test successfully, you can then have a look at several plots visualizing the line distribution in the different movies; lines spoken by Hermoine, Ron and Harry;  the distribution of gender, bloodstatus, hair colour, eye colour and loyalty for each house.

## Getting Started

You will need to install following libraries for implementation: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, random, distance
